## Datasets
The benchmark datasets utilized in this project are PDBbind and CrossDocked.
### PDBbind
To process the dataset from scratch, you need to download PDBbind_v2020 from [here](http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/download.php), save it in `data`, unzip it, and run the following scripts in `data`:
* [clean_pdbbind.py](data/clean_pdbbind.py) will clean the original dataset, extract the binding affinity and calculate QED, SA, LogP, and TPSA of ligands. It will generate a `index.pkl` file and save it in `data/PDBbind_v2020` folder.
    ```bash
    python clean_pdbbind.py --source PDBbind_v2020
    ```
* [extract_pockets.py](data/extract_pockets.py) will extract the pocket file from a 10 A region around the binding ligand in the original protein file.
    ```bash
    python extract_pockets.py --source PDBbind_v2020 --desti PDBbind_v2020_pocket10
    ```
* [split_dataset.py](data/split_dataset.py) will split the train, validation and test set.
    ```bash
    python split_dataset.py --path PDBbind_v2020_pocket10 --desti PDBbind_pocket10_split.pt --train 17327 --val 1825 --test 100
    ```

### CrossDocked
To process the dataset from scratch, you need to download CrossDocked2020 v1.1 from [here](https://bits.csb.pitt.edu/files/crossdock2020/), save it in `data`, unzip it, and run the following scripts in `data`:
* [clean_crossdocked.py](data/clean_crossdocked.py) will filter the original dataset and retain the poses with RMSD < 1 A. It will generate a `index.pkl` file and create a new directory containing the filtered data .
    ```bash
    python clean_crossdocked.py --source CrossDocked2020 --dest crossdocked_v1.1_rmsd1.0 --rmsd_thr 1.0
    ```
* [extract_pockets.py](data/extract_pockets.py) will extract the pocket file from a 10 A region around the binding ligand in the original protein file.
    ```bash
    python extract_pockets.py --source crossdocked_v1.1_rmsd1.0 --dest crossdocked_v1.1_rmsd1.0_pocket10
    ```
* [split_dataset.py](data/split_dataset.py) will split the training and test set. We use the split file `split_by_name.pt`.
    ```bash
    python split_dataset.py --path data/crossdocked_v1.1_rmsd1.0_pocket10 --dest data/crossdocked_pocket10_pose_split.pt --fixed_split data/split_by_name.pt
    ```

## Training
### Trained model checkpoint
* `trained.pt` is the checkpoint file trained on the PDBbind dataset with labeling.
* `bond_trained.pt` is the checkpoint file of bond predictor trained on the PDBbind dataset. This should be used as guidance during the sampling process.

### Training from scratch
```bash
python scripts/train.py --config configs/train/train.yml
```
If you want to resume the training, you need to revise the train.yml file. Set `resume` to True and set `resume_ckpt` to the checkpoint that you want to resume, eg. 100000.pt. In addition, `log_dir` should be defined by `args.logdir` (the previous training directory) instead of using `get_new_log_dir` function.

### Training bond predictor
```bash
python scripts/train_bond.py --config configs/train/train_bond.yml
```

## Inference
```bash
python scripts/sample.py --config configs/sample/sample.yml
```
Place the downloaded or self-trained checkpoint files in the `ckpt` folder.

The values of logp, tpsa, sa, qed, aff can be adjusted to generate molecules with desired properties.
* `logp` is octanol-water partition coefficient. It ranges from -2.0 to 5.0. High value indicates hydrophobicity and low value indicates hydrophilicity. The logp values of most drugs are located between 1.0 and 3.0.
* `tpsa` is topogical polar surface area. High value indicates high water solubility and low value indicates high lipid solubility. The tpsa values of most drugs are located between 20 and 60.
* `sa` is synthetic accessibility. It ranges from 0.0 to 10.0. The lower the sa value, the easier the organic synthesis. The reasonable sa values of most drugs are located between 0.0 and 5.0.
* `qed` is quantitative estimate of drug-likeness. It ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. The higher the qed value, the greater the drug-likeness.
* `aff` is binding affinity. It is calculated by -log<sub>10</sub>(*K<sub>d</sub>* or *K<sub>i</sub>* or *IC<sub>50</sub>*). High value indicates high binding affinity. For instance, 8.0 corresponds to 10 nM *K<sub>d</sub>* or *K<sub>i</sub>* or *IC<sub>50</sub>*.

### Sample molecules for given protein pocket
Revise the sample.yml file to sample molecules for any given protein pocket.  
Set `target` to pocket file (eg. sample/3ztx_pocket.pdb), set `gen_mode` to denovo, and set `mode` to pocket.  
In sample folder, you can use the protein file and ligand file to extract the pocket file. For example:
```bash
python extract_pockets.py --protein 3ztx_protein.pdb --ligand 3ztx_ligand.sdf --radius 10 --pocket 3ztx_pocket.pdb
```

### Sample molecules for all pockets in test set
Revise the sample.yml file to sample molecules for all pockets in test set. Set `target` to None and set `mode` to test.
If you want to sample for the PDBbind test set, then set `path` to data/PDBbind_v2020_pocket10, set `split` to data/PDBbind_pocket10_split.pt, set `protein_root` to data/PDBbind_v2020, and set `dataset` to pdbbind.
If you want to sample for the CrossDocked test set, then set `path` to data/crossdocked_v1.1_rmsd1.0_pocket10, set `split` to data/crossdocked_pocket10_pose_split.pt, set `protein_root` to data/crossdocked_v1.1_rmsd1.0, and set `dataset` to crossdocked. 

### Sample molecules based on given fragments (lead optimization)
Revise the sample.yml file to sample molecules based on given fragments. Set `target` to pocket file (eg. sample/3ztx_pocket.pdb), set `frag` to fragment file (eg. sample/3ztx_frag.sdf), set `gen_mode` to frag_cond or frag_diff, and set `mode` to pocket.

## Evaluate
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --config configs/eval/eval.yml
```
The docking mode can be chosen from {qvina, vina_score, vina_dock, none}.
